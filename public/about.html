<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer | Self-Taught Software Developer</h2>
<p>I am a dedicated and self-taught software developer specializing in full-stack web development. 
  Currently, I am deepening my expertise in JavaScript and its associated technology frameworks,
  including React JS, Next JS, Node JS, and Express JS. I am also focused on integrating these 
  front-end frameworks with various backends, APIs, and databases. My goal is to join a dynamic team 
  where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and further develop my capabilities in web-
  development to create impactful and efficient software solutions.</p>
